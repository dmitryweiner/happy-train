## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls
- **Click switches** ![Switch](assets/switch.png) to change track directions
- **Click semaphores** ![Semaphore](assets/semaphore.png) to stop/start trains
- **Click level number** to pause/unpause the game

### Objectives
1. Guide the train(s) to the destination station ![Station](assets/station.png)
2. Avoid derailments and collisions
3. Use switches to direct trains along the correct path
4. Control semaphores to manage train timing
5. Complete all levels to win!

### Game Elements
- **Locomotive** ![Locomotive](assets/locomotive.png): The engine that pulls the train
- **Wagons** ![Wagon1](assets/wagon1.png) ![Wagon2](assets/wagon2.png): Cargo cars attached to the locomotive
- **Switches**: Junction points where tracks split - click to toggle direction
- **Semaphores**: Traffic signals that can stop trains when closed
- **Stations**: Destination points where trains must arrive

## 🎨 Level Editor

The game includes a built-in level editor accessible via `editor.html`:

### Features
- **Track placement**: Draw rails, curves, and switches
- **Object placement**: Add semaphores, stations, and trains
- **Configuration export**: Generate level data in JSON format
- **Visual preview**: Real-time preview of your level
- **Import/Export**: Save and load custom levels

### Usage
1. Open `editor.html` in your browser
2. Select tools from the toolbar
3. Click on the grid to place elements
4. Configure level settings in the right panel
5. Export your level configuration

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

### Unit Tests
- Switch logic validation
- Utility function testing
- Game state management

### Visual Tests
- Rendering consistency checks
- Asset comparison testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Train Movement
- Trains automatically accelerate and move along tracks
- Speed is limited by curves and track conditions
- Trains can be stopped by closed semaphores
- Collisions result in game over

### Switch Logic
- Switches have two states: straight and turn
- Cannot be changed while a train is on the switch
- Default state is "straight"
- Visual feedback shows current switch position

### Level Progression
- Complete levels sequentially
- Progress is automatically saved
- Final level shows victory animation
- Can restart from any completed level

## 🔧 Configuration

Game constants can be modified in `constants.js`:
- Grid dimensions (15x10 cells by default)
- Cell size (40px)
- Train speed and acceleration
- Rendering parameters
